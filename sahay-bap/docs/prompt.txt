Now I am going to describe requirements for the app that allows  people to register and look for mentorship from discovery api that we already implemented. one can register with name, email, phone number and telegram handle on this platform and should be able to activate the account with OTP sent to telegram using telegram api. once user is logged in he/she should be able to type in search query for the mentorship search and initiate a request for subscribing. Can you please write rust api code and svelte html/js necessary for this? assume postgresql as database and I would prefer to use tokio and diesel
